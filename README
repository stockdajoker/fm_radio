We have to find a way to record audio from the AudioManager. The current way to do this is to record the output from
the speakerphone using the mic. This is largely inefficient.

Useful libraries:
Once we figure out how to record from AudioManagers we should be able to use the MediaRecorder library to 
analyze the waves.

Another solution is to use RDS. RDS's limitations is that it's limited to 64 characters per packet and 
has a margin of error.
